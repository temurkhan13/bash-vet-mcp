- Severity ladder (INFO=0 / LOW=1 / MEDIUM=5 / HIGH=15 / CRITICAL=40), risk_score capped at 100.
- Verdict ladder (CLEAN / CAUTION / REVIEW / BLOCK / UNVERIFIED).
- 50+ test cases covering rule-by-rule detection, chain-mode escalation, risk-score ladder, and MCP protocol wiring.
- GitHub Actions CI + release workflow with PyPI Trusted Publishing via OIDC.
